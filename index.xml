      <description>I have been interested in setting up a home server for a while, and we have some other patrons who are interested in this too. I figured with the whole pandemic things, and working from home, this would be a good excuse.
To start with, I ordered a Raspberry Pi 4 with 8GB of ram. This should have plenty of oomph for the things I want to do while still being silent and power efficient.</description>

      <title>Using Let’s Encrypt to secure local services</title>

      <description>Hopefully, at this point everyone has secured all their public facing services with HTTPS. Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt makes this quick and easy to do (not to mention free!). What about local services that are only available on your lan though? This is tougher because normal verification methods don&amp;rsquo;t work, yet it is still important. Part of a defense in depth strategy is to always assume you are in a hostile environment, and with all the router vulnerabilities, Universal Plug and Play problems, and issues such as DNS rebinding attacks, it is not a good assumption that there are no malicious actors on your lan.</description>

      <description>In the past two months, I have attended the Public Library Association’s annual conference, Code4Lib 2018, and my wife’s grandmother turned 100. It has been a busy couple of months. Code4lib especially filled my head with lots of new ideas which I will right about more over the coming weeks.
On the first day of Code4lib we had half day workshops. The first workshop that I attended was on Docker and virtual machines with Ed Hill.</description>

      <description>I have wanted to get some kind of gaming going at our library for a long time now. The problem with most modern games is that they assume that you have your own account and aren’t really made for settings like public libraries. Enter the Retropie. This Raspberry Pi based system contains emulators which allow you to play roms from a whole host of retro game systems. This will allow us to offer gaming in a format more friendly to multiple users.</description>

      <description>Notice anything different about this site? Hopefully the answer is no. My library is transitioning from Digital Ocean to Amazon Web Services for our web presence and this site is our test case. We were very happy with Digital Ocean as a host, but Tech Soup offers $2000 in AWS credit for $175 (or $80 if you belong to their Boost program). We had been averaging somewhere around $30/month for Digital Ocean, so if we assume that Amazon is close on their pricing (which may or may not be a justified assumption), we stand to save $185 just from making that switch.</description>

      <description>Which steps you take to protect yourself online depend entirely on your personal threat model. I have tried to select things that are broadly applicable and are easy to implement. This is a topic where you can absolutely deep dive, but remaining totally anonymous online is very difficult (if not impossible) and takes a lot of effort and discipline. Fortunately, the vast majority of people don’t require that level of protection.</description>

      <title>Tarsnap – Online backups for the truly paranoid</title>

      <description>With Crashplan stopping its free consumer service, I have had to find a new backup solution for my home computers. After looking at many options, Tarsnap was what I settled on. They advertise themselves as “Online backups for the truly paranoid”. This is a true claim, and their security is certainly one thing that draws me to them, but they are also easy to use and quite inexpensive.
Tarsnap is built from the ground up to be secure.</description>

      <title>Yet Another Digital Signage Solution on the Cheap</title>

      <description>The first-generation Google Chromecast dongle was made available in 2013 for around $35 dollars. I acquired one of these devices for our library so that I could wirelessly cast our Samsung Galaxy Tab’s screen to our AV system during classes and training sessions, and thus handily avoid the need for wired tethering along with the necessary adaptors to effect this.
The device has served us well, but with the advance of screen resolution technologies in mobile devices as well as the demands of mirroring the same, it makes sense to upgrade to Google’s latest model refresh, the Chromecast Ultra model, which promises better overall performance, less wireless lag, and support for 4K resolution and high dynamic range, among other things.</description>

      <description>I have heard people say that everyone should know how to code. This struck me as wildly unlikely. People are just to busy and have too much on their plates to all become software developers. However, I also thought that their reasoning was correct. Learning to code lets you use your computer for what it is really good at. Doing repetitive tasks over and over again, the same way each time.</description>

      <title>How large is your attack surface?</title>

      <guid>https://chuckmcandrew.com/post/2017/08/25/how-large-is-your-attack-surface/</guid>
      <description>Attack surface is a term used in computer security to describe your vulnerabilities. It is simply the ways that you can be attacked. A larger attack surface means more ways to attack you. A smaller attack surface means less ways to attack you. One of the most effective ways we have of increasing our security is to shrink our attack surface. There are other important things we need to do, such as doing security updates and selecting trustworthy software, but that largely depends on things that are out of our control.</description>

      <description>There is a great tool called haveibeenpwned put out by Troy Hunt. You can enter an email address or username into this website, and it will tell you if it has been involved in a data breach. This is great so that you can quickly change your password for a compromised account. Troy now has a service that will check passwords against data breaches as well. If you don’t want to put your password into a random third-party website, you can put in a sha1 hash of your password instead or you can download the entire 5.</description>

      <description>A recent email thread on the Tor relay operators email list has me thinking about DNS. DNS is like the phonebook of the internet. For example, when you go to https://techielibrarians.com, you don’t actually go there. You go to 159.203.158.3 (IPv4) or 2604:a880:400:d0::14ab:4002 (IPv6). Obviously, it is far easier to remember techielibrarians.com than a whole string of numbers. That is why we have DNS. DNS is simple in concept, but can provide some complications in practice.</description>

      <description>The Lebanon Public Libraries in Lebanon, NH run on free and open source software. This software accounts for about 95% of all the software that we use. This is not the norm for a library, but it should be. This is software that is in agreement with the values of librarianship. It allows us as librarians to serve our patron’s without the compromises that come from proprietary software.
There are many benefits tofree and open source software.</description>

      <description>We have an exciting new program at our library. We are going to start loaning out laptops for patrons to take home. We will have two pools, one for long term loan, and one for short term loan. The short term loans will be for three weeks. That program will start in 2018. I will write more about that program when we get closer to launching it. However, the long term loan laptops will be available in the very near future.</description>

      <description>We have all had the frustration of software not working the way we want it to. Maybe it is an annoying feature, or something not working the way it is supposed to. We all complain about software because it sometimes makes our jobs more difficult. Nothing wrong with a little venting. However, we should also be letting the software makers know about these problems. Just about any software product out there should have some kind of bug report option.</description>

      <description>This topic seems to come up a lot so I thought that I would write a quick post on things to look for when you buy computers for your library. I will address some of the things that I take into consideration when buying items. However, I can’t tell you how to weight these considerations. You know your library and patrons best.
New, refurbished, or used Obviously we all like getting new gear, and as I have argued before, computers are as important to libraries as books these days.</description>

      <description>On this Blog we’ve featured digital signage resources using free or low-cost software and hardware, including Porteus-Kiosk running on flash drives and Chrome on ChromeBits.I’ve been using Porteus-Kiosk for a couple of OPAC deployments in my library, but the initial setup and sluggish performance when running on a flash drive are less than optimal.Thanks to a recent tip from Darrell Eifert from the Lane Memorial Library, I’ve found an impressive alternative, and it’s called OpenKiosk.</description>

      <description>At a recent training that Mark and I did for the NHLA Paralibrarians section, we were ask a question about how to stay current on computer security topics. This can be quite a challenge, especially for busy librarians with a lot of other things to keep track of. The easy answer is that you do it the same way that you keep current on anything else. However, I thought it might be useful to share some of the specific ways that I keep on top of things.</description>

      <description>Our ISP, Comcast, has recently rolled out native IPv6 support in our area, so this week I decided to set up our library to be dual stack. The first thing that had to happen was getting a Comcast tech to change out our SMC modem for a Netgear modem. According to Comcast tech support, the SMC doesn&amp;rsquo;t support IPv6.
Once the modem was switched out, I went in and turned off every feature I could in the modem.</description>

The recently published new recommendations which overturn some previously widely recommended practices. You can read the original publication at https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html. Here is a breakdown of how to set a secure password policy according to NIST.
Favor longer passwords NIST recommends a minimum password length of 8 characters. If you must have a maximum length, they recommend at least 64 characters.</description>

Not unusually, the major OS platforms, like Windows, Apple iOS and OSX and now macOS, Android, etc., form the natural basis for the subject matter, since it relates to what most people are using and are familiar with in their daily lives. I’ve even offered a class on home networking, but quickly realized during the class presentation that most people are not using their own routers, but are using Comcast Gateways which are hybrid modems and routers.</description>

      <description>This insightful and very practical presentation was delivered by Laura Horwood-Benton of the Portsmouth Library. In her engaging presentation, she shared some tricks and simple methods for creating professional looking publicity materials, based on universally recognized design principles as well as her own practical experience that have garnered positive feedback from colleagues and patrons alike.
She mentioned several key design components that include alignment, proximity, contrast, space, color, text, position, and repetition, all of which combine to create the architecture of a given production.</description>

      <description>Recently, I was browsing https://haveibeenpwned.com/ and found that one of my old email addresses had been involved in a data breach. Looking into it more, it seemed that the company involved (adobe, go figure) had done a poor job of securing the passwords so there is a good chance that my password was compromised. Like everyone else on the planet, I used to use a couple of passwords for all of my accounts.</description>

      <description>At this year’s 2017 NHLA Spring Conference I participated in an ITS Roundtable session which featured a number of interesting topics for discussion. The free-flow of roundtable discussions is often an ideal atmosphere for the willing exchange of ideas as well as the participation of those who might otherwise be less inclined to share. Topics for discussion included…

      <description>Dogfooding or Eating your own dogfood is a concept in software development that says that companies should use their own software. This approach is meant to help developers experience what their customers will.The hope is that this will find bugs quicker and improve usability. It can reveal problems that only become obvious if you use something day to day.
Libraries care about our patron experience. We want all our services to be easy to find and use.</description>

      <description>People have been preaching about the importance of https for a long time now. However, it seems that many libraries and library vendors haven&amp;rsquo;t yet got the message. I decided to add my voice to the mix to argue for the importance of https from a public library perspective. We need to ensure that our websites, library catalogs, and ILS&amp;rsquo;s are all running on https, and we need encourage vendors to use https for all their services as well.</description>

      <description>With congress rolling back FCC privacy rules on ISPs, there has been a lot of interest in ways that you can protect yourself from snooping. One of the best, and easiest, ways to protect yourself is by using a reliable VPN. Right now, ISPs have access to everywhere you go on the web. If you are using https (and you should be), they can&amp;rsquo;t see which specific web page of a site you are on, but they can tell which sites you visit, in which order, and how long you spend on them.</description>

      <description>Backups are incredibly important today, yet are often overlooked. Good backups can protect you against hardware failures, carelessly deleting files, and even ransomware. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have backups of your data, then you don&amp;rsquo;t care about your data. It is as simple as that. Hardware dies at the most inconvenient times. Ransomware is a fact of life these days. A careless click can ruin your whole day. When I was first setting up our current infrastructure at the Lebanon Public Libraries, I accidentally deleted our entire shared drive.</description>

      <description>Every Tuesday afternoon, from 3:00-4:30pm, I offer a tech class spanning topics of general interest to the public. This week’s tech class was on the subject of how to cleanup and optimize your computer (with a focus on Windows computers), and I admittedly wasn’t too surprised at the high attendance. The average Windows computer user is often beset with slow performance issues due in part to low-end system specs (marketed as a budget-friendly products), system clutter and detritus as a result of use as well as misuse, and even potential malware.</description>

      <description>In January Chuck McAndrew and I presented a program for grades 3-7 using the Scratch program that is free through the MIT website. Through Chuck’s initiatives we have designated chromebooks for use in training and programs. We were able to use these giving each participant one to use. We also projected to a large screen to both introduce Scratch and it’s features as well as allowing an opportunity for the kids to share what they created with each other towards the end of the program.</description>

      <description>At the Lebanon Public Libraries, we have been working on expanding our STEM programming. I am sure that a lot of other libraries are in the same boat. We recently ran a Scratch program for kids at our library that went really well (we’ll have a post up soon with more specifics about that program). We wanted to build on the success of the Scratch program and recently got some grant money, so we decided to purchase some Finch Robots.</description>

      <description>As a corollary to Chuck M.’s recent, compelling post on “The Importance of IT Training in Libraries,” it occurs to me how important technology training in terms of general tech support to patrons has become, even to the point of becoming the “new reference.” In a given month at my library, and I suspect at other libraries, too, tech support inquiries far outweigh and often eclipse what would be considered to be the traditional reference inquiries, such as finding an historical reference or what cemetery (of many in town) is the oldest where a decedent of interest might be buried.</description>

      <description>An alternative to the Chromebit option mentioned in Chuck’s post on the digital signage deployment at his library is a free, open-source solution called Porteus-Kiosk. This (1) OS paired with an (2) old PC or Thin Client, even with minimal hardware specs, (3) a 4GB flash drive, and a (4) monitor, be it a spare computer monitor of a desirable size, or large-screen TV with VGA or HDMI ports, will serve handily as an in-house digital signage solution to promote library events and services.</description>

      <description>One of the fallacies which librarians battle is that libraries exist for the sake of books. It is understandable that people make this mistake. For decades, libraries have been associated with books, but that doesn’t make it correct. Books are a means rather than an end. Libraries exist to promote access to information. For centuries, books were the best way to store and make accessible large amounts of information, hence the association between libraries and books.</description>

      <description>It’s a real pleasure to be part of this new blog for “techie” librarians! It’s like having a new library space that’s just waiting to be filled with new books. I look forward to the exchange of ideas that this venue will afford us, and I can’t wait to read about (and also share) tips and tricks, best practices, successes as well as challenges, that we all face as “techie” librarians in our respective libraries!</description>

      <description>Recently, I was tasked with coming up with a digital signage solution for our library. This was for interior displays rather than outdoor signage. We had a few hundred dollars available for this project, but nowhere near enough to buy a commercial solution. Originally, we wanted to run a slideshow for Veteran’s Day, but planned to change it into general purpose advertising for library events after Veteran’s Day was past. Ideally I wanted something that would be very simple to keep up to date.</description>

This website runs on a FAMP (FreeBSD, Apache, Mysql, PHP) stack. Most web servers today run on LAMP stacks running some flavor of Linux as their operating system.</description>
