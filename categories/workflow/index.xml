      <description>At a recent training that Mark and I did for the NHLA Paralibrarians section, we were ask a question about how to stay current on computer security topics. This can be quite a challenge, especially for busy librarians with a lot of other things to keep track of. The easy answer is that you do it the same way that you keep current on anything else. However, I thought it might be useful to share some of the specific ways that I keep on top of things.</description>

      <description>Our ISP, Comcast, has recently rolled out native IPv6 support in our area, so this week I decided to set up our library to be dual stack. The first thing that had to happen was getting a Comcast tech to change out our SMC modem for a Netgear modem. According to Comcast tech support, the SMC doesn&amp;rsquo;t support IPv6.
Once the modem was switched out, I went in and turned off every feature I could in the modem.</description>

      <description>Recently, I was browsing https://haveibeenpwned.com/ and found that one of my old email addresses had been involved in a data breach. Looking into it more, it seemed that the company involved (adobe, go figure) had done a poor job of securing the passwords so there is a good chance that my password was compromised. Like everyone else on the planet, I used to use a couple of passwords for all of my accounts.</description>

      <title>If it isn’t backed up, it isn’t important.</title>

      <description>Backups are incredibly important today, yet are often overlooked. Good backups can protect you against hardware failures, carelessly deleting files, and even ransomware. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have backups of your data, then you don&amp;rsquo;t care about your data. It is as simple as that. Hardware dies at the most inconvenient times. Ransomware is a fact of life these days. A careless click can ruin your whole day. When I was first setting up our current infrastructure at the Lebanon Public Libraries, I accidentally deleted our entire shared drive.</description>

      <description>It’s a real pleasure to be part of this new blog for “techie” librarians! It’s like having a new library space that’s just waiting to be filled with new books. I look forward to the exchange of ideas that this venue will afford us, and I can’t wait to read about (and also share) tips and tricks, best practices, successes as well as challenges, that we all face as “techie” librarians in our respective libraries!</description>
