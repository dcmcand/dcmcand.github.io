      <description>Which steps you take to protect yourself online depend entirely on your personal threat model. I have tried to select things that are broadly applicable and are easy to implement. This is a topic where you can absolutely deep dive, but remaining totally anonymous online is very difficult (if not impossible) and takes a lot of effort and discipline. Fortunately, the vast majority of people don’t require that level of protection.</description>

      <description>With congress rolling back FCC privacy rules on ISPs, there has been a lot of interest in ways that you can protect yourself from snooping. One of the best, and easiest, ways to protect yourself is by using a reliable VPN. Right now, ISPs have access to everywhere you go on the web. If you are using https (and you should be), they can&amp;rsquo;t see which specific web page of a site you are on, but they can tell which sites you visit, in which order, and how long you spend on them.</description>
