      <description>In the past two months, I have attended the Public Library Association’s annual conference, Code4Lib 2018, and my wife’s grandmother turned 100. It has been a busy couple of months. Code4lib especially filled my head with lots of new ideas which I will right about more over the coming weeks.
On the first day of Code4lib we had half day workshops. The first workshop that I attended was on Docker and virtual machines with Ed Hill.</description>

      <title>Retro Gaming at the library</title>

      <description>I have wanted to get some kind of gaming going at our library for a long time now. The problem with most modern games is that they assume that you have your own account and aren’t really made for settings like public libraries. Enter the Retropie. This Raspberry Pi based system contains emulators which allow you to play roms from a whole host of retro game systems. This will allow us to offer gaming in a format more friendly to multiple users.</description>

      <description>Notice anything different about this site? Hopefully the answer is no. My library is transitioning from Digital Ocean to Amazon Web Services for our web presence and this site is our test case. We were very happy with Digital Ocean as a host, but Tech Soup offers $2000 in AWS credit for $175 (or $80 if you belong to their Boost program). We had been averaging somewhere around $30/month for Digital Ocean, so if we assume that Amazon is close on their pricing (which may or may not be a justified assumption), we stand to save $185 just from making that switch.</description>

      <description>Inspired by the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Surveillance Self Defense, I have put together a five part course covering privacy and security for people ranging from basic to advanced. Here are my notes and slides from the first of the classes. This covers basic topics that every computer user should be familiar with.

      <title>Tarsnap – Online backups for the truly paranoid</title>

      <description>With Crashplan stopping its free consumer service, I have had to find a new backup solution for my home computers. After looking at many options, Tarsnap was what I settled on. They advertise themselves as “Online backups for the truly paranoid”. This is a true claim, and their security is certainly one thing that draws me to them, but they are also easy to use and quite inexpensive.
Tarsnap is built from the ground up to be secure.</description>

      <description>I have heard people say that everyone should know how to code. This struck me as wildly unlikely. People are just to busy and have too much on their plates to all become software developers. However, I also thought that their reasoning was correct. Learning to code lets you use your computer for what it is really good at. Doing repetitive tasks over and over again, the same way each time.</description>

      <description>There is a great tool called haveibeenpwned put out by Troy Hunt. You can enter an email address or username into this website, and it will tell you if it has been involved in a data breach. This is great so that you can quickly change your password for a compromised account. Troy now has a service that will check passwords against data breaches as well. If you don’t want to put your password into a random third-party website, you can put in a sha1 hash of your password instead or you can download the entire 5.</description>

      <title>Open source software and the values of librarianship</title>

      <description>The Lebanon Public Libraries in Lebanon, NH run on free and open source software. This software accounts for about 95% of all the software that we use. This is not the norm for a library, but it should be. This is software that is in agreement with the values of librarianship. It allows us as librarians to serve our patron’s without the compromises that come from proprietary software.
There are many benefits tofree and open source software.</description>

      <title>Loaning out laptops</title>

      <description>We have an exciting new program at our library. We are going to start loaning out laptops for patrons to take home. We will have two pools, one for long term loan, and one for short term loan. The short term loans will be for three weeks. That program will start in 2018. I will write more about that program when we get closer to launching it. However, the long term loan laptops will be available in the very near future.</description>

      <title>Buying computers for your library</title>

      <description>This topic seems to come up a lot so I thought that I would write a quick post on things to look for when you buy computers for your library. I will address some of the things that I take into consideration when buying items. However, I can’t tell you how to weight these considerations. You know your library and patrons best.
New, refurbished, or used Obviously we all like getting new gear, and as I have argued before, computers are as important to libraries as books these days.</description>

      <title>Staying Current</title>
      <link>https://chuckmcandrew.com/post/2017/06/20/staying-current/</link>

      <description>At a recent training that Mark and I did for the NHLA Paralibrarians section, we were ask a question about how to stay current on computer security topics. This can be quite a challenge, especially for busy librarians with a lot of other things to keep track of. The easy answer is that you do it the same way that you keep current on anything else. However, I thought it might be useful to share some of the specific ways that I keep on top of things.</description>

      <title>Native IPv6 with Comcast Business and pfSense 2.3</title>

      <description>Our ISP, Comcast, has recently rolled out native IPv6 support in our area, so this week I decided to set up our library to be dual stack. The first thing that had to happen was getting a Comcast tech to change out our SMC modem for a Netgear modem. According to Comcast tech support, the SMC doesn&amp;rsquo;t support IPv6.
Once the modem was switched out, I went in and turned off every feature I could in the modem.</description>

      <description>Dogfooding or Eating your own dogfood is a concept in software development that says that companies should use their own software. This approach is meant to help developers experience what their customers will.The hope is that this will find bugs quicker and improve usability. It can reveal problems that only become obvious if you use something day to day.
Libraries care about our patron experience. We want all our services to be easy to find and use.</description>

      <title>The Importance of HTTPS</title>

      <description>People have been preaching about the importance of https for a long time now. However, it seems that many libraries and library vendors haven&amp;rsquo;t yet got the message. I decided to add my voice to the mix to argue for the importance of https from a public library perspective. We need to ensure that our websites, library catalogs, and ILS&amp;rsquo;s are all running on https, and we need encourage vendors to use https for all their services as well.</description>

      <description>Backups are incredibly important today, yet are often overlooked. Good backups can protect you against hardware failures, carelessly deleting files, and even ransomware. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have backups of your data, then you don&amp;rsquo;t care about your data. It is as simple as that. Hardware dies at the most inconvenient times. Ransomware is a fact of life these days. A careless click can ruin your whole day. When I was first setting up our current infrastructure at the Lebanon Public Libraries, I accidentally deleted our entire shared drive.</description>

      <description>One of the fallacies which librarians battle is that libraries exist for the sake of books. It is understandable that people make this mistake. For decades, libraries have been associated with books, but that doesn’t make it correct. Books are a means rather than an end. Libraries exist to promote access to information. For centuries, books were the best way to store and make accessible large amounts of information, hence the association between libraries and books.</description>

      <description>It’s a real pleasure to be part of this new blog for “techie” librarians! It’s like having a new library space that’s just waiting to be filled with new books. I look forward to the exchange of ideas that this venue will afford us, and I can’t wait to read about (and also share) tips and tricks, best practices, successes as well as challenges, that we all face as “techie” librarians in our respective libraries!</description>
