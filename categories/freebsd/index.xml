      <description>Our ISP, Comcast, has recently rolled out native IPv6 support in our area, so this week I decided to set up our library to be dual stack. The first thing that had to happen was getting a Comcast tech to change out our SMC modem for a Netgear modem. According to Comcast tech support, the SMC doesn&amp;rsquo;t support IPv6.
Once the modem was switched out, I went in and turned off every feature I could in the modem.</description>

      <description>I thought it might be appropriate to talk about the setup for this website as my first post. I used setting up this blog to try out some things that I have heard about for a while and wanted to try. The basics:
This website runs on a FAMP (FreeBSD, Apache, Mysql, PHP) stack. Most web servers today run on LAMP stacks running some flavor of Linux as their operating system.</description>
