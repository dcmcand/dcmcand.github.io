      <description>I have been interested in setting up a home server for a while, and we have some other patrons who are interested in this too. I figured with the whole pandemic things, and working from home, this would be a good excuse.
To start with, I ordered a Raspberry Pi 4 with 8GB of ram. This should have plenty of oomph for the things I want to do while still being silent and power efficient.</description>

      <description>This is part 2 of 10 of a series of relatively short posts that focus on things that everyone should think about to be safe when using computers. This is based on a class that I teach which can be found at https://chuckmcandrew.com/class/onlinesecuritybasics/. Feel free to use the class as is, or fork it on Github and make it your own.

      <description>Which steps you take to protect yourself online depend entirely on your personal threat model. I have tried to select things that are broadly applicable and are easy to implement. This is a topic where you can absolutely deep dive, but remaining totally anonymous online is very difficult (if not impossible) and takes a lot of effort and discipline. Fortunately, the vast majority of people don’t require that level of protection.</description>

      <description>Inspired by the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Surveillance Self Defense, I have put together a five part course covering privacy and security for people ranging from basic to advanced. Here are my notes and slides from the first of the classes. This covers basic topics that every computer user should be familiar with.

      <title>How large is your attack surface?</title>
      <link>https://chuckmcandrew.com/post/2017/08/25/how-large-is-your-attack-surface/</link>

      <description>Attack surface is a term used in computer security to describe your vulnerabilities. It is simply the ways that you can be attacked. A larger attack surface means more ways to attack you. A smaller attack surface means less ways to attack you. One of the most effective ways we have of increasing our security is to shrink our attack surface. There are other important things we need to do, such as doing security updates and selecting trustworthy software, but that largely depends on things that are out of our control.</description>

      <description>We have all had the frustration of software not working the way we want it to. Maybe it is an annoying feature, or something not working the way it is supposed to. We all complain about software because it sometimes makes our jobs more difficult. Nothing wrong with a little venting. However, we should also be letting the software makers know about these problems. Just about any software product out there should have some kind of bug report option.</description>

      <title>Staying Current</title>

      <description>At a recent training that Mark and I did for the NHLA Paralibrarians section, we were ask a question about how to stay current on computer security topics. This can be quite a challenge, especially for busy librarians with a lot of other things to keep track of. The easy answer is that you do it the same way that you keep current on anything else. However, I thought it might be useful to share some of the specific ways that I keep on top of things.</description>

      <description>The National Institute of Standards and Technology is a US Government organization which does many thing including defining password standards for the government. The recently published new recommendations which overturn some previously widely recommended practices. You can read the original publication at https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html. Here is a breakdown of how to set a secure password policy according to NIST.
Favor longer passwords NIST recommends a minimum password length of 8 characters. If you must have a maximum length, they recommend at least 64 characters.</description>

      <title>The Less Than Typical Subject for a Library Tech Class</title>

      <description>Every Tuesday, except the last Tuesday of the month, I offer a tech class on various subjects. Not unusually, the major OS platforms, like Windows, Apple iOS and OSX and now macOS, Android, etc., form the natural basis for the subject matter, since it relates to what most people are using and are familiar with in their daily lives. I’ve even offered a class on home networking, but quickly realized during the class presentation that most people are not using their own routers, but are using Comcast Gateways which are hybrid modems and routers.</description>

      <description>Recently, I was browsing https://haveibeenpwned.com/ and found that one of my old email addresses had been involved in a data breach. Looking into it more, it seemed that the company involved (adobe, go figure) had done a poor job of securing the passwords so there is a good chance that my password was compromised. Like everyone else on the planet, I used to use a couple of passwords for all of my accounts.</description>

      <description>At this year’s 2017 NHLA Spring Conference I participated in an ITS Roundtable session which featured a number of interesting topics for discussion. The free-flow of roundtable discussions is often an ideal atmosphere for the willing exchange of ideas as well as the participation of those who might otherwise be less inclined to share. Topics for discussion included…
  when is the ideal time to offer tech classes
  if libraries video-record their classes, and if so, what recording tools do they use</description>

      <title>VPN’s for privacy</title>

      <description>With congress rolling back FCC privacy rules on ISPs, there has been a lot of interest in ways that you can protect yourself from snooping. One of the best, and easiest, ways to protect yourself is by using a reliable VPN. Right now, ISPs have access to everywhere you go on the web. If you are using https (and you should be), they can&amp;rsquo;t see which specific web page of a site you are on, but they can tell which sites you visit, in which order, and how long you spend on them.</description>

      <description>Backups are incredibly important today, yet are often overlooked. Good backups can protect you against hardware failures, carelessly deleting files, and even ransomware. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have backups of your data, then you don&amp;rsquo;t care about your data. It is as simple as that. Hardware dies at the most inconvenient times. Ransomware is a fact of life these days. A careless click can ruin your whole day. When I was first setting up our current infrastructure at the Lebanon Public Libraries, I accidentally deleted our entire shared drive.</description>

      <description>Every Tuesday afternoon, from 3:00-4:30pm, I offer a tech class spanning topics of general interest to the public. This week’s tech class was on the subject of how to cleanup and optimize your computer (with a focus on Windows computers), and I admittedly wasn’t too surprised at the high attendance. The average Windows computer user is often beset with slow performance issues due in part to low-end system specs (marketed as a budget-friendly products), system clutter and detritus as a result of use as well as misuse, and even potential malware.</description>

      <description>In January Chuck McAndrew and I presented a program for grades 3-7 using the Scratch program that is free through the MIT website. Through Chuck’s initiatives we have designated chromebooks for use in training and programs. We were able to use these giving each participant one to use. We also projected to a large screen to both introduce Scratch and it’s features as well as allowing an opportunity for the kids to share what they created with each other towards the end of the program.</description>

      <title>The importance of IT training in libraries</title>

      <description>One of the fallacies which librarians battle is that libraries exist for the sake of books. It is understandable that people make this mistake. For decades, libraries have been associated with books, but that doesn’t make it correct. Books are a means rather than an end. Libraries exist to promote access to information. For centuries, books were the best way to store and make accessible large amounts of information, hence the association between libraries and books.</description>

      <description>It’s a real pleasure to be part of this new blog for “techie” librarians! It’s like having a new library space that’s just waiting to be filled with new books. I look forward to the exchange of ideas that this venue will afford us, and I can’t wait to read about (and also share) tips and tricks, best practices, successes as well as challenges, that we all face as “techie” librarians in our respective libraries!</description>
