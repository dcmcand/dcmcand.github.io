      <description>Recently, I was tasked with coming up with a digital signage solution for our library. This was for interior displays rather than outdoor signage. We had a few hundred dollars available for this project, but nowhere near enough to buy a commercial solution. Originally, we wanted to run a slideshow for Veteran’s Day, but planned to change it into general purpose advertising for library events after Veteran’s Day was past. Ideally I wanted something that would be very simple to keep up to date.</description>
